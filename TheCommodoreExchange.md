## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

The Commodore Exchange- Brooke Landry

This concept was developed during Human Computer Interaction all of last semester, Fall 2020. The Commodore Exchange connects Vanderbilt students to encourage buying, selling, and trading within the Vanderbilt community. The Commodore Exchange diverts materials from the landfill while saving students money on college essentials. The Commodore Exchange facilitates buying and selling items between students by providing a platform where users can post or search through existing posts of items for sale. Users may post an item for sale and include tags by which it can be searched, and the post will remain visible until the user marks it as sold or the time limit for the post is reached. Buyers can search to find an item that they are interested in and contact the seller through a chat built into the website. This experience will be fully available for both mobile and desktop users.

The Commodore Exchange improves the current mode of buying/selling called Reuse, Vandy! that utilizes a GroupMe to attempt to find people to sell to or locate items that you would like to purchase. The current interface was inefficient due to the inability to manage notifications, causing you to receive every single one or none at all, essentially frustrating the user to the point where they mute all notifications or leave the group, and if all notifications are muted, there is little point of being in the group, since you are unaware when items become available or when someone is interested in your item you are selling. Additionally, inability to search or filter items creates a problem, forcing you to read through all messages in a singular feed. Thirdly, the new interface makes buying and selling convenient and safe for Vanderbilt students by linking single sign on to the interface, allowing payments to be processed using Commodore Cash, and providing safe features to message students. Streamlining the process of browsing, communicating, and completing transactions all in the same app allows an overall more satisfying experience that will be more likely to be repeated using the interface. The site should aim to provide convenience and usability from the buyer and user experience; since the process is generally the same on both sides, users on both sides do not need to learn a completely different process in order to transition from browsing items and buying to posting and selling.
